#Issues or Features

  The main issue that will come up while using this app is that the API will no longer be available. Since that 
  will be the main issue, finding a new API that is in depth enough to use will be the main challenge of the 
  app in the future.
  
  If you feel the need to contribute a feature, the main one we weren't able to get around to is adding a dynamoDB
  database to the project so that information can be stored. Another good feature to add would be to have the option
  for doctors to create or load patient info from the database so it can be used by them later on.
